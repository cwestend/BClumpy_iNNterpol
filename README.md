# BClumpy_iNNterpol
Neural Network interpolation over CAT3D-WIND AGN torus models for the new improved BayesClumpy 

We trained a new Neural Network over the more than 124k models of CAT3D-WIND (see http://cat3d.sungrazer.org/)
in the manner of https://github.com/cwestend/iNNterpol but adding a Residual Network (ResNet)
configuration to be able to cope with the deeper layer configuration.
